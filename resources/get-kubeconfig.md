# Set Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Kubeconfig

Ensure that your AKS cluster context is set with the `az aks get-credentials` command. Follow the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli#connect-to-the-cluster).

This extension assumes that the cluster your Kubeconfig is set to is the one you wish to use.
